## Introduction
Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB, developed a Full Stack MERN Application and learned how to build a product - from start to finish. The App is called "Reminisce" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app

## To Do
* Add web app link
